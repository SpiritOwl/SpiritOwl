> _"Wiring together old sparks and new signals."_

Welcome.  
I'm a systems thinker, circuit tinkerer, and story-seeker wandering the seam between retro charm and future possibility.  
I build tools, machines, interfaces, and inner worlds — mostly for the joy of seeing them come alive.

### 🔭 Current Focus

- **Perkins** — my local AI assistant built on Linux, speaking in shell, script, and signal.
- **ShipsBell** — a real-time, naval-style clock that honors the watch system at sea.
- **Layline** — a 2D sailing simulator to teach racing tactics through real physics.
- **Inspiration Engine** — a data pipeline that collects signals from across the web and turns them into creative fire.

### 🧪 Darkgreen Labs

Darkgreen Labs is my personal R&D workshop —  
a fictional facility where the aesthetic matters as much as the logic.  
Think **Team Zissou meets NASA**, with a dash of **midnight hacker radio**.

Projects here are often:
- Modular, symbolic, a little strange.
- Meant to be *used*, but also *felt*.
- Built to explore the edge of personal computing, automation, and self-hosted AI.

Some experiments live under this umbrella:
- `ShipsBell`
- `SoulPlot`
- `KGDN-FM` (a fictional 70s-era AI radio station)
- `Tomorrow Engine` (creative prioritization through code)

### 💾 I Believe

- Computers should feel like *instruments* again.
- Retro isn't nostalgia — it's continuity.
- There's value in building what doesn't need to be built.
